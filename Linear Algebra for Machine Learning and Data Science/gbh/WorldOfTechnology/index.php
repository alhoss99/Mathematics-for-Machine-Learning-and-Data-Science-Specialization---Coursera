                    <p>Computer science specializes in the study of computers and computational systems, including their
                        basic and algorithmic foundations, and the need for information related to information. It also
                        involves following active learning in general to learn theoretical and specific games (such as
                        algorithms and protocols); To help request, process, transform and store data. The feasibility
                        and structure of these educational processes are also analyzed.</p>

                    <p>The programming specialty is one of the specializations that occupies a great position in the
                        current era, as this specialty is concerned with studying the ideal way to develop various
                        programs that are used in many things, the most important of which are solving various problems,
                        storing and retrieving information, converting data, and also communicating using technology,
                        and the importance of this appears. Specialization is clear in the interest of developed
                        countries in studying this field to a large extent at the university academic level. There are
                        also some countries that add the study of computer programming to the curricula and courses in
                        various schools.</p>
