                        Creativity techniques are designed to increase the amount of new ideas. This approach is based
                        on
                        the belief that the greater the number of ideas, the greater the chance that one of them will
                        have value. Some of these techniques include randomly selecting an idea (such as choosing a word
                        from a list), thinking of analogies to the undesirable situation, and encouraging related
                        inspirational thoughts that lead to a solution. These techniques are described in Creativity
                        Techniques.
